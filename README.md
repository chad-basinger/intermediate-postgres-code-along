# Project Summary

In this project, we'll continue to use <a href="https://postgres.devmountain.com/" target="_blank">postgres.devmountain.com</a> to create more intermediate SQL queries.

## Foreign Keys - New Table

### Summary

When creating tables we can specify a column as having a foreign key. The datatype of our column must match the datatype of the column we are linking to. The most common foriegn key is a primary key which is usually an integer.

### Instructions 

* Create a new table called `movie` with a `movie_id`, `title`, and `media_type_id`.
  * Make `media_type_id` a foreign key to the `media_type_id` column on the `media_type` table.
* Add a new entry into the `movie` table with a `title` and `media_type_id`.
* Query the `movie` table to get your entry.

<summary> <code> SQL Solutions </code> </summary>

<details>

<summary> <code> Create movie table </code> </summary>

```sql
CREATE TABLE movie (
  movie_id SERIAL,
  title TEXT,
  media_type_id INTEGER, 
  FOREIGN KEY(media_type_id) REFERENCES media_type(media_type_id)
);
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Add movie </code> </summary>

```sql
INSERT INTO movie ( title, media_type_id ) VALUES ( 'Aladdin', 3 );
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Query movie Table </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie;
```

</details>

</details>

## Foreign Keys - Existing Table

### Summary

We can also add a foreign key to an existing table. Let's add one to our `movie` table that references `genre_id` on the `genre` table.

### Instructions

* Add a new column called `genre_id` that references `genre_id` on the `genre` table.
* Query the `movie` table to see your entry.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solutions </code> </summary>

<details>

<summary> <code> Add Foreign Key </code> </summary>

```sql
ALTER TABLE movie ADD COLUMN genre_id INTEGER REFERENCES genre(genre_id);
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Query movie Table </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie;
```

</details>

</details>

## Updating Rows

### Summary

We don't want to leave the `genre_id` equal to `null` so let's add a value using the update command. With an update command you always want to use a `WHERE` clause. If you don't you will overwrite data on all records.

### Instructions

* Update the first entry in the `movie` table to a `genre_id` of `22`.
* Query the `movie` table to see your entry.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solutions </code> </summary>

<details>

<summary> <code> Updating First Entry </code> </summary>

```sql
UPDATE movie SET genre_id=22 WHERE movie_id=1;
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Query movie Table </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie;
```

</details>

</details>

## Using Joins

### Summary

Now that we know how to make foreign keys and change data, let's do some practice queries. The simplest way to use a foreign key is via a join statement. 

### Instructions

* Join the `artist` and `album` tables to list out the artist name and album name.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> artist and album Join </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT a.title, ar.name 
FROM album a 
JOIN artist ar ON a.artist_id = ar.artist_id;
```

</details>

## Using nested queries/sub-selects

### Summary

The next way to use a primary key is with a nested query/sub-select statement. By using parenthesis we can do a select inside of a select. This is really effective when you have a foreign key link between two tables because now we can filter our main query by criteria on a referenced table.

### Instructions

* Use a sub-select statement to get all tracks from the `Track` table where the `genre_id` is either `Jazz` or `Blues`.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> Sub-Select </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Track 
WHERE genre_id IN ( SELECT genre_id FROM genre WHERE name = 'Jazz' OR name = 'Blues' );
```

</details>

## Setting values to null

### Instructions

* Update `Phone` on the `Employee` table to `null` where the `EmployeeId` is `1`.
* Query the `Employee` table to get the employee you just updated.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solutions </code> </summary>

<details>

<summary> <code> Setting to null </code> </summary>

```sql
UPDATE Employee SET Phone = null WHERE EmployeeId = 1;
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Query the Employee Table </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE EmployeeId = 1;
```

</details>

</details>

## Querying a null value

### Summary

Sometimes you want to know when there is no value. For example, let's use the `customer` table to figure out which customers do not have a company.

### Instructions

* Get all customers from the `customer` table who do not have a company.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> No Company customers </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * from customer WHERE Company IS null;
```

</details>

## Group by

### Summary

How many albums does each artist have? We could count manually, but no! Group by allows us to do aggregate counts.

### Instructions

* Select all artist ids, artist names, and count how many albums they have.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> Group By </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT ar.artist_id, ar.name, COUNT(*) 
FROM artist ar
JOIN album a ON ar.artist_id = a.artist_id 
GROUP BY ar.artist_id;
```

</details>

### Challenge

Modify the solution to order the album count by largest to smallest.

## Distinct

### Summary

Distinct is great if you want to get a dataset with no duplicates. 

### Instructions

* Get all countries from the `customer` table with no duplicates.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> No Duplicate Countries </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM customer;
```

</details>

## Delete Rows

### Summary

Deleting rows can be dangerous if you are not cautious. Always do a select of what you plan to delete to make sure that you are going to delete the correct records.

### Instructions

* Select all records from the `customer` table where fax is null;
* Delete all records from the `customer` table where fax is null;

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solutions </code> </summary>

<details>

<summary> <code> All null fax numbers </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE fax IS null;
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Delete null fax customers </code> </summary>

```sql
/* The delete won't work since they are children using a foreign key. However, if there wasn't a foreign key, you would successfully delete all customers WHERE fax is null */
DELETE FROM customer WHERE fax IS null;
```

</details>

</details>
